## What is KAI?

**KAI** (Knowledge and Accessibility Interface) is a simulated smartphone assistant. A voice/chat-powered assistant — designed to teach users how to perform common digital tasks through guided, step-by-step walkthroughs.

Instead of just telling you what to do, KAI *shows* you. When you give it a command, it opens the relevant app and highlights exactly where to tap, what to type, and what to expect — like having a patient guide walking you through your phone for the first time.

## Core Features

### 🤖 The KAI Assistant
The central AI assistant accessible from the dock on the home screen. KAI understands natural language commands in **three languages** and responds with voice synthesis, on-screen text, and interactive guides.

**Two input modes:**
- **Voice** — Tap the mic bar and speak your command
- **Chat** — Switch to text mode and type your command; KAI replies in a chat bubble interface

---

### 💬 AI Chat (Gemini-Powered)

In **Chat mode**, KAI goes beyond built-in commands. If your message isn't a recognized command, KAI automatically forwards it to **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** and replies with a real AI-generated answer — all while staying in character as KAI.

**How it works:**
- Built-in commands always take priority (e.g. "send money", "open GCash")
- Any unrecognized message in chat mode is sent to Gemini as a fallback
- A animated `···` typing indicator appears while KAI is thinking
- Gemini replies are displayed as KAI chat bubbles, not spoken aloud
- Only available in **Chat mode** — Voice mode uses built-in commands only

**What you can ask:**
- General knowledge — *"What is the capital of Japan?"*
- Practical questions — *"How do I boil an egg?"*
- Math — *"What is 15% of 850?"*
- Tagalog/Filipino questions — *"What does pagmamahal mean?"*
- Anything conversational — *"Tell me a fun fact"*

## Language Notes

- KAI detects the **active language** set in Settings and only matches commands in that language.
- If you speak in the wrong language, KAI will tell you and remind you to change the setting.
- All three languages always reply in **English** — the language setting only affects what words KAI *listens* for.
